# Predicting The Future Bike Sales 

- As part of a data analytics project,I leveraged machine learning and statistical modeling
techniques to develop a predictive model for bike sales.
- This project involved extensive data analysis, feature engineering ,and model training to
forecast future sales accurately.
- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Gathered historical sales data, including variables such
as time of year, weather conditions, marketing campaigns, and product attributes.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted in-depth EDA to identify patterns,
correlations, and factors influencing bike sales. Visualized data trends and insights using
tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created relevant features, such as seasonality indicators, holiday
effects, and lagged variables, to capture the underlying dynamics of bike sales.
- **Model Selection:** Explored and compared various machine learning algorithms,
including linear regression, decision trees, and time series forecasting models. Selected
the most suitable model based on performance metrics and cross-validation.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trained the chosen model using historical data and
evaluated its predictive accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).
